            <p>As the world becomes increasingly automated, it is forcing underwriters to adapt and navigate a new risk environment. Meanwhile  insurers are<br> leveraging the potential of AI themselves to remain competitive, improve processes and increase efficiency. Lloyd's shave commissioned two reports in<br> collaboration with the University of Surrey that explore these trends in more detail.<br>"Taking control: artificial intelligence and insurance" analyses the associated risks of AI implementation as well as the potential for AI to help insurers<br> improve their operations and develop new products. Building on this, “Taking control: robots and risk” investigates the impact “collaborative robots” (or<br> cobots) on the economy, and the subsequent risks implications for the insurance industry.</p>

            <h3> Taking control: artificial intelligence and insurance</h3>
            <p>This report identifies four risks areas for AI: trust and transparency, ethics, security and<br> safety. It highlights that as artificial intelligence systems become more complex, cyber<br>breaches are likely to have an even greater impact. The report also explores new business<br>opportunities for insurers from developing new products for companies using the AI to<br>applying the technology to improve insurance processes and deliver better value.</p>

            <h3> Taking control: robots and risk</h3>
            <p>In the future millions of jobs could be taken over by increasingly sophisticated robots or<br> cobots (“collaborative robots”), according to various predictions. This report explores<br>robotics potential to significantly change the risk landscape in many parts of the economy,<br>including: manufacturing, agriculture, healthcare and retail. It also explores the opportunity<br>for insurers to collaborate with clients as data from cobots will provide a much greater<br>understanding of risk and offer opportunities for improved risks and pricing models.</p>
